> ellipsis. (n) *the omission from speech or writing of a word or words that are superfluous or able to be understood from contextual clues.*

> "What is drama but life with the dull bits cut out.”

Hitchcock

> Ellipsis is both a narrative device and also the most basic idea in film editing. Ellipsis has to do with the omission of a section of the story that is either obvious enough for the public to fill in (their heads) or concealed for a narrative purpose, such as suspense or mystery.

> editors are the third and final storytellers of any film. Writers and directors will cut as much as they can, but they never know what will work or not. They write and direct scenes hoping to get the message across and obtain the best performances out of their talent. But it is the editor’s job to make the final judgement call. If he can improve on the work of his peers and cut even more “dull bits,” then by all means he has to do it.

Ellipsis Means Cutting: Because Less is More

January 6, 2019 at 09:17PM

This is called the enter-late-leave-early rule, and here’s what it means. When filming or writing a scene, filmmakers should start that scene at the latest possible moment for it to be understood and felt by the audience. For example, if you are doing a scene about a couple having a fight in a restaurant, it may not be relevant to show the couple leaving home, arriving at the restaurant, parking, and being seated. Perhaps a better kicker for that story beat would be to simply start the scene with the husband ordering filet mignon, and the wife nagging him because they can’t afford it; and it spirals down from there. They are talking divorce before the dessert arrives. Of course, this is just an example. If there’s “juice” in showing the couple getting ready for the night out and driving to their destination, then you should definitely include all those scenes.
