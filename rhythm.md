### Rhythm & Repetition

Focussing on the trailer as a way to introduce rhythm in editing and the use of discontinuity to condense narratives into short form.

### Walter Murch The rule of 6

1. Emotion: How will this cut affect the audience emotionally at this particular moment in the film?
2. Story: Does the edit move the story forward in a meaningful way?
3. **Rhythm: Is the cut at a point that makes rhythmic sense?**
4. Eye Trace: How does the cut effect the location and movement of the audience’s focus in that particular film?
5. Two-Dimensional Plane of Screen: Is the axis followed properly?
6. Three-Dimensional Space: Is the cut true to established physical and spatial relationships?

> .. like choreographers, editors shape the trajectories of movement across shots, scenes, and sequences, the transitions of movement between the shots. Like choreographers, editors work with the temporal and spatial dynamics of movement to create a flow of moving images that carry meaning. And just like choreographers, editors will often describe the way a “change to the entire component can affect the interacting network of elements”.

### Repetition

> *Leit-motif (reiteration of theme) — Often it is interesting for the scenarist especially to emphasise the basic theme of the scenario. For this purpose exists the method of reiteration. Its nature can easily be demonstrated by an example. In an anti-religious scenario that aimed at exposing the cruelty and hypocrisy of the Church in employ of the Tsarist regime, the same shot was several times repeated: a church-bell slowly ringing and, superimposed on it, the title: “The sound of bells sends into the world a message of patience and love.” This piece appeared whenever the scenarist desired to emphasise the stupidity of patience, or the hypocrisy of the love thus preached.

 Pudovkin, Vsevolod Illarionovich, 1926

> *Whenever a symbol like light is used, it is far more effective when it’s contrasted with its opposite. Similarly, the use of the circular is greatly augmented when its opposite, the linear, plays alongside. Circular imagery can inherently suggest confusion, repetition, and time, but it can also generate less obvious shadings when used with contrasting elements*.

### ACTIVITY

Take the five narratives and additional cutaways from the recent Cafe Project production, create a 40 second teaser for the film. Considerations to include: mood, tone, narrative (how much to reveal, how much to keep ambiguous?), pacing and not least, soundtrack. Where possible try to let the visual and soundtrack (of your choice but please avoid licensed material) tell the story, keeping dialogue to a minimum.

Please bring finished trailer to the next session along with a short, informal presentation on an editor/director’s use of rhythm within their work - a short clip alongside how their style, technique and approach influence your practice.
